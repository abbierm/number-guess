# Number Guess

Number Guess is an api game where you try to guess a secret number between 0 and 999.  The game takes users guesses and responds with "higher", "lower", or "correct" if the user gets the correct number. 


I created this game to experiment and practice using FastAPI and to save and store game states between API calls. 


## Getting Started

#### 1. install requirements:
    pip install fastapi

    pip install "uvicorn[standard]"


#### 2. Run the command:

    uvicorn main:app --reload



#### 3.
